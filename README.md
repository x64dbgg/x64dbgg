**What I'm Working On**

I'm currently studying the intricate details of the Windows API and Windows internals, aiming to build a robust understanding of how the operating system functions at its core. This involves:

    Developing tools and utilities using C++ and WinAPI.
    Exploring the depths of kernel-mode programming to write efficient and secure drivers.
    Continuously improving my reverse engineering skills to understand and deconstruct software.

I apply this knowledge to develop personal software, some of which integrates third-party tools to enhance gameplay experiences.
